# AccSaber Frontend

## Requirements

- npm
- angular cli
- avatars and song covers served on `http://localhost:8081`
- AccSaber backend running on `http://localhost:8080`

## Serving the images

If you use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) simply run `http-server -p 8081
` in the folder in which the backend saves the images.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
